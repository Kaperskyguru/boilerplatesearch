          Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the
          utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive
          elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

          Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
          ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
          committing to an actual design project.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then I found a
          <a href="https://flowbite.com"
            >component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite</a
          >. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
          buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
          conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

        <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
        <p>
          First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library
          is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
          Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
          components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can
          optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can check out the
          <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/"
            >quickstart guide</a
          >
          to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project.
          But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to
          follow the build tools steps so that you can purge and minify the
          generated CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and
          e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your projects even
          faster. You can check out this

            >comparison table</a

          to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro
          version of Flowbite.

        <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
        <p>
          While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some
          key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit
            out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey and buy
            something from the site you’ve designed? By running a usability
            test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design
            once it’s live;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR
            consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to your
            data protection team and they can test it for real;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or
            even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on
            experience;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive
            medium to preview and test design elements, designers and developers
            can understand each other — and the project — better.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
        <p>
          Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
          ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
          committing to an actual design project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start by including the CSS file inside the
          <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
        <h4>Type properties</h4>
        <p>
          A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique,
          certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface represents shared
          patterns across a collection of letters.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Type classification</h3>
        <h4>Serif</h4>
        <p>
          A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning
          or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs are called serif
          typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the following:
        </p>
        <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
          <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
          <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
        </ul>
        <img
          src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <ol>

        </ol>

            choice for your next SaaS application.

        <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how
          close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you’re simply preparing
          a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity prototype — like
          a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be
          more than enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability
          testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with on-brand colors, fonts and
          imagery — could help get more pointed results.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow,
          try to think as your user would when interacting with your product.
          While you can fine-tune this during beta testing, considering your
          user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on
          the right path.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both
          organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by
          building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what will
          be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery,
          and list each element by order of priority. This way, you’ll be able
          to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at the heart of your
          design.
        </p>
