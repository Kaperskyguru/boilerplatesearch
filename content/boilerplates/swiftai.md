description: "SwiftAI Boilerplate Pro is a production-ready SwiftUI starter kit designed for building modern AI-powered iOS apps fast. It includes a clean MVVM architecture, modular Swift Packages, secure OpenRouter integration using Supabase Edge Functions, fully built Auth flows (Email + Apple Sign-In), RevenueCat subscription setup, and a polished design system with dark/light themes. You get nine foundational modules out of the box—Networking, Storage, AI Client, Onboarding, Payments, Settings, Push Notifications, Error Handling, and App Config—battle-tested in a real App Store app (Capishi). Perfect for indie makers and teams who want to ship high-quality apps without reinventing boilerplate."
